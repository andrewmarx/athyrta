## Introduction

This package aims to provide a data downloader and cacher with features that simplify reproducibility in data analyses. It will primarily be designed to pair with a collection of private web apps and, eventually, a publicly available data management web app. Once the API is stabilized, other web apps and services will be welcome to incorporate the API, allowing users of those tools to utilize this package in their data analysis pipeline.

Alpha versions of this package (0.0.0.*) serve only as proof-of-concepts for relevant private parties and should not be used by others. Eventually, beta versions will be released suitable for third-party usage.
